# Future Enhancements for Tileverse

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the Tileverse library, focusing on features that could be implemented after the core functionality is stable.

## 1. Distributed PMTiles Generation

### Overview

For large datasets and cloud environments like GeoServer Cloud, implementing distributed PMTiles generation would allow workloads to be distributed across multiple processes or nodes, leveraging horizontal scaling for improved performance.

### Key Components

1. **Task Coordination System**
   - Split generation work into discrete tasks
   - Distribute tasks across worker nodes
   - Track progress and handle failures

2. **Worker Implementation**
   - Process assigned tile generation tasks
   - Report progress and results to coordinator
   - Handle transient failures and retries

3. **Artifact Storage**
   - Store intermediate tile data and metadata
   - Support cloud storage options (S3, etc.)
   - Enable efficient data sharing between workers

4. **Final Assembly Process**
   - Collect and organize tiles from all workers
   - Build directory structures and metadata
   - Create the final PMTiles file

### Integration with GeoServer Cloud

- Native integration with GeoWebCache for tile generation
